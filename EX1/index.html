    <h1>Introduction of HTML!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the world of code!<br />
      Last year, millons of learners from our community started with HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why?<br />
      <strong>HTML is the skeleton of all web pages.</strong> It's often the first
      language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to
      front-end development work.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as
      <a href="">images</a>, text, or <a href="">videos</a>.
